								<p class="lead">At Creativitea we have provided clients with website design in Surrey for 8 years now and continue to work with local businesses to build their brand through their digital presence.</p>

								<p>Surrey offers a huge opportunity for businesses because of the transport links to London and the South coast so it sees a lot of good business networking opportunities. It's an affluent area being so close to London so most of our industry experience in Surrey is in the Luxury or Professional Market.</p>
								
								<h3>Website Design Solutions Surrey</h3>

								<p>Our award-winning digital team pride themselves on being able to build complex solutions using creative thought, cognitive research and on budget. We pride ourselves on delivering results based on business objectives making the work we do extremely valuable.</p>
								
								<p>The digital world has changed. No longer should clients be expected to be stuck with custom web systems on expensive maintenance contracts. Website’s need to be deployed quickly and efficiently whilst giving clients the flexibility to work with the site as they feel fit.</p>
								
								<p>At Creativitea, we recognise that our key strength is using existing systems like Drupal, Shopify and Stripe to knit together solutions that gives clients the best value website design and development.</p>
								
								<h3>Contact us</h3>
								<p class="yellow lead">&ndash;</p>
								<p class="lead">We are looking for clients with a great story to tell and the drive to do something a little different. If this is you, please contact us today and we'll get together for a chat.</p>

								<h3>Local experience</h3>
								
								<p>We've designed websites for Surrey based clients such as <a href="http://www.creativitea.co.uk/portfolio/tantemarie-restaurant" title="Tante Marie Culinary Academy Website Design">Tante Marie Culinary Academy</a> and <a href="http://www.creativitea.co.uk/portfolio/djst" title="Don't Just Sit There, Sell Something Ltd Website Design">DJST</a>.</p>
								
								<p>The local gaming industry has also served us well in the past with Guildford once being known as the gaming capital of Britain. We've worked for Electronic Arts, Trion Worlds, Activision and Atari who have all been based here.</p>
								
								<p>We are also proud to have supported Surrey based charities with their website design projects. These include Communilab and Surrey Youth Focus.</p>
								<h4>The Studio</h4>

								<p>2016 saw us move our studio from Guildford to Sutton. This offers a more direct route to London whilst still having a presence in Surrey, our original home. With direct transport links into central London and the wider areas of Surrey, we are able to continue to provide our branding services to both areas.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately due to the privacy of some of our clients work we're under contract to not allow visitors to the Surrey studio. So we have setup space at the Impact Hub at King’s Cross which offers a fantastic space for workshops, meetings and working with the team directly.</p>
