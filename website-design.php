		                <p>I am a hybrid designer / developer so whilst I love designing digital products - I also like to get under the hood and make things work with front-end development (HTML/CSS).</p>
		                <p>This skillset has allowed me to work on some major websites for some of the countries leading brands as well as independent businesses and charities. I have experience with many CMS and CRM systems including <a href="https://www.hubspot.com" target="_blank">Hubspot</a>, <a href="https://www.marketo.com" target="_blank">Marketo</a>, <a href="https://www.wordpress.com" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.com" target="_blank">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://www.grabaperch.com" target="_blank">Perch</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal</a>.</p>

Outlining these key objectives enables us to design and develop key activities surrounding your website design.

In our experience the most successful digital projects start with an investment into researching user patterns, analysing content and planning your Information Architecture (IA). Activities include competitor benchmarking, user focus groups or user surveys, heat-mapping and eye-tracking and mobile-device testing.</p>

I work in an iterative process with a range of tools to design and explain our thought processes throughout the design phase.

I use a range HTML, CSS and JavaScript at the core of our projects but enhance the power of other tech like AJAX, PHP and HTML5. I have a range of experiences with frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation which I often use to develop rich user experiences for our clients in a timely manner. Activities may include; responsive website design, mobile applications, interactive prototypes, accessibility &amp; standards and interactive animated content.</p>

                                            <p>With the increasing amount of devices and internet access points available nowadays, it's important to test digital design solutions on a range of devices.
