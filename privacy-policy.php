						<h1>Creativitea Privacy Policy &amp; Cookies</h1>
						
						<p>We are all worried about our online privacy these days so I thought I should probably say something about your privacy when using this site</p>

						<h2>Your email address</h2>

						<p>There are a few reasons why you might choose to give me your email address.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>You may purchase something from the site.</li>
							<li>You subscribe to my newsletter.</li>
							<li>You post a comment on this blog.</li>
							<li>In each case your email address is stored securely although not always on my server. Newsletter subscriptions are held on Mailchimp. Contact Forms are saved to Insightly. For information on their privacy policies please visit their respective websites.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>That said I can promise you that we will never share your email address with anybody outside these suppliers and our own company Creativitea.</p>

						<p>If at any point you wish your email address removed from any of these systems just drop me an email at <a href="mail:rik@creativitea.co.uk">rik@creativitea.co.uk</a>.</p>

						<h2>Cookies</h2>

						<p>We use cookies on the Creativitea website to track user activity on the site and to enable various types of functionality. While we will endeavour to keep the list below updated, the Creativitea site relies on many third party services and the list may therefore become out of date if those services alter the cookies they use.</p>

						<p>Please note that all of these Cookies exist to enable functionality on the website and not for advertising purposes. If you do not wish these cookies to be tracked you can disable them in your browser, but this may negatively effect your experience on the site.</p>

						<p>There are two types of cookie you may encounter when using this website:</p>

						<p>First party cookies: these are our own cookies, controlled by us and used to provide information about usage of our site.</p>

						<p>Third party cookies: these are cookies found in other companiesâ€™ internet tools which we are using to enhance our site, for example Facebook or Twitter have their own cookies, which are controlled by them.</p>

						<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the cookies use on this site feel free to drop me a line and I will do my best to help.</p>
