						<h3 class="m-t-0">What I did</h3>
						<p>Fat Beehive was tasked with building the new Campaign Toolkit website designed to help activists create their campaigns to help raise awareness. I worked with the agency as part of a remote team to put together the new front-end code (HTML and CSS) for the new design which was later implemented into the Drupal CMS.</p>
						<p>Throughout this project I was tasked with making creative decisions to implement new branding and illustration elements. The homepage is quite complex with it's overlapping illustrations and curve patterns which caused a few challenges when dealing with responsive layouts - especially with smaller mobile devices. I broke these up into several layers and positioned them as separate background images along the site's breakpoints.</p>
						<p>The resulting homepage is soft and approachable for the users. The toolkit is easy to use and offers the user all the information they need to create successful campaigns.</p>
						<p>It's work like this that has the potential to change the world for the better. One I am very proud of playing my part.</p>
