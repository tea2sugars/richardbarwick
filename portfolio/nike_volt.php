								<h5 class="m-t-0">History</h5>
								<p>Marchon distributes eyewear to the worlds most prestigious department stores, boutiques and Duty Free partners globally. There portfolio of brands include a wide range of high fashion and sports labels that generate over 16 million frames sold annually.</p>
								<p>World Duty Free is the UK’s leading travel retailer and offer thousands products across their stores including ranges from cosmetics to confectionery, fragrances to fashion accessories, spirits to souvenirs, skincare to sunglasses at airports across the country.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 m-b-30">
								<h5 class="m-t-0">My Brief</h5>
								<p>Marchon approached us to design the creative and roll out collateral for the launch of Nike Sunglasses being available in World Duty Free stores. In conjunction with World Duty Free, they devised a promotion that was to ounce the arrival of Nike’s new summer eyewear collection, offering customers two benefits of this in the form of a exclusive discount and a chance to win a pair of the famed frames.</p>
							</div>
														
							<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 m-b-30">
								<h5 class="m-t-0">What I did</h5>
								<p>The art direction of the creative had to adhere to Nike's recognisable brand and existing product strap-line “See Sport Better’, taking core elements of typography, colour and their contemporary design systems which communicates their core brand values.</p>

<p>The focus of the promotion was to use the newly released ‘Volt’ range. Various frames from within the seasons collection featuring in Nike’s ‘Volt’ colour. First introduce in 2011, the ‘Volt’ colour (a bright lime) is considered a brand colour has has become synonymous with brand and the swoosh. Volt is a hue that falls into the colour space that is most sensitive to the human eye, so we built a identity system for the campaign around this, giving it a focal and striking position. This was achieved by a ‘less is more’ approach using a two tone colour palette, minimum typeface selection and weight with bold product imagery.</p>

<p>We developed a creative that use’s a identity system built of a dynamic layout based on the angle of ‘swoosh’, giving an impression of speed and power in relation to the eyewear sports theme. The strength of the volt colour is off set by the contrast of a secondary colour selection of deep rich black, bold gridded typography and reworked for purpose product imagery as a focal point.</p>

<p>The final creative was rolled out across various touch points of advertising, in store posters including large light box graphic panels, customer vouchers with a perforated completion slip and promotion merchandise.</p>
