								<h5 class="m-t-0">History</h5>
								<p>AnalogFolk have HSBC Bank on retainer providing Design consultancy and branding.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 m-b-30">
								<h5 class="m-t-0">My Brief</h5>
								<p>From January 2017 to January 2018 I worked with AnalogFolk on the Design Review Board (DRB). A dedicated team to one of the world's largest banking and financial services organisations, HSBC. </p>
							</div>
														
							<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 m-b-30">
								<h5 class="m-t-0">What I did</h5>
								<p>I was responsible for conducting design and UX reviews for all digital collateral in the Retail and Wealth Management verticals.</p>

<p>I ensured that every piece of work (500+ reviews) created by the business or other agencies adhered to the banks brand standards. I was also tasked with guiding global teams on design and UX issues arising to ensure approval by HSBC and go-live.</p>

<p>I provided art-direction remotely through video conferences and detailed reports. I also attended sprints and various workshops with multiple agencies and the client.</p>

<p>I also provided HSBC with reports about their own brand guidelines and UX standards to help these grow inline with the increasing business and technological demands.</p>
