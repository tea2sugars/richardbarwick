									<blockquote>I worked with Rik Barwick on a number of web projects during my tenure at Buyapowa. We worked together on simplifying the web landscape which had been botched together, to provide a seamless integration between legacy static HTML, a WordPress blog, and Hubspot marketing system - not an easy task. </blockquote>

								<h5 class="m-t-0">History</h5>
								<p>Lycamobile is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) that operates across the globe, selling pay-as-you-go SIM cards to consumers wanting to make international calls at value.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 m-b-30">
								<h5 class="m-t-0">My Brief</h5>
								<p>We were asked by Lycamobile to work with them on revitalising their app’s functionality and user interface, for their internal team to build.</p>
								<p>The app is to give customers access to their mobile accounts quickly and easily, giving them everything they need to know; from how much they’re spending to helpful tips to get the most out of their account and phone.</p>
							</div>
														
							<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 m-b-30">
								<h5 class="m-t-0">What I did</h5>
								<p>We mapped and designed a simple user experience, with the end objective to deliver an actionable road-map for the user to access the data they need. The use of a simple ‘tap’ interface takes the user through a series of screens, making the experience a smooth and easy one.</p>

<p>The user interface features a flat design using the brands existing identity system based around the use of colour and typeface, with a bespoke icon set.</p>

<p>The App design was for the Android operating system, with other operating systems to be considered in the future. The new design now is being used as a &lsquo;best practice&rsquo; guide for other app designs within the service and product portfolio of Lycamobile.
