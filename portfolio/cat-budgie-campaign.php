								<h5 class="m-t-0">History</h5>
								<p>Freeview is the UK’s no.1 TV platform and the only free-to-air digital terrestrial television service in the United Kingdom. It is delivered by the company DTV Services Ltd, a joint venture between the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky and transmitter operator Arqiva.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 m-b-30">
								<h5 class="m-t-0">My Brief</h5>
								<p>Freeview approached us to be a supporting creative partner, working along side with Leo Burnett for their new &lsquo;Entertainment is even better when it’s free&rsquo; campaign running over the year, with the specific task of looking at the printed collateral featuring outdoor, press and retail point of sale, working with the lovable couple, Cat and Budgie, and the Freeview left behinds.</p>
							</div>
														
							<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 m-b-30">
								<h5 class="m-t-0">What I did</h5>
								<p>Due to the assets for each campaign not being available until toward the end of the TV adverts production, timings and deadlines were incredibly tight, so forward planning was a must. From the get go we worked closely with the team at Freeview, reviewing all collateral that was needed to make a defined list of assets and their requirements, advising on how and what was needed as early as possible, ensuring that each delivery of the campaigns printed collateral went on time!</p>

<p>The main focus was to work with the original images shot from live shoots and rework these into assets that could be rolled out across the various printed collateral. The adding and removal of backgrounds; giving marketing messaging and key brand elements of logo and call to actions space to breathe, the flexibility to be used in various compositions of landscape and portrait, and photo realistic retouching; removal and adding of elements within the original images, where undertaken to achieve flexibility needed.</p>

<p>This flexibility enabled us to change background colours, compositions and various marketing messages. This also meant that we where able to react to the tight timings of some briefs and production deadlines of outdoor and press materials.</p>
<p>We are very proud to have been involved in these campaigns, delivering various artworks in support of each of the TV adverts launches, across outdoor, press and point of sale.</p>

						<h5>Work in progress...</h5>
						<p>A lot of skilful art working was needed to convert images created for screen into something that could be used across different marketing channels. The below are a few examples</p>
