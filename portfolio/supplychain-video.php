								<h5 class="m-t-0">History</h5>
								<p>Carphone Warehouse is a British mobile phone retailer, with over 2,400 stores across Europe. The company has been a subsidiary of Dixons Carphone since August 2014, which was formed by the merger of its former parent Carphone Warehouse Group with Dixons Retail. </p>

								<h5 class="m-t-0">Our Brief</h5>
								<p>Carphone approached us to help them to produce a video for their Supply Chain team, demonstrating the processes and updates within the business to support retail during the Christmas season. The challenge was to make it watchable (normally seen as quite a dull subject), engaging and interesting so that it stimulated and motivated the retail teams.</p>
							</div>
														
							<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 m-b-30">
								<h5 class="m-t-0">What we did</h5>
								<p>We partnered with the Carphone internal design team, and built a ‘talking heads' style video with bright and bold animations.</p>

<p>To make it watchable, we needed to make sure that content was natural, not corporate, so we focused the direction on the bright and fun side of the brand and using real people from the Supply Chain team - no actors here! We defined the storyboard, a talking heads style with naturally occurring branding in the form of animated graphics highlighting key information within each scene. We utilised the internal teams resources to produce the filmed content, whilst our focus for production was on the animated graphics featuring various bespoke designed illustrations and infographics and opening title credits.</p>
